    <h2>Where Did She Come From?</h2>
    <p>Joy is a 4-year-old Plott Hound who was the result of irresponsible backyard breeding. She was found wandering the streets of Ogden, just skin and bones, but as loving as can be, and was taken in by a local animal shelter. After gaining enough weight, she was put up for adoption and brought home by a local young couple to give her the best years of her life.</p>
    <p>Little did they know, this dog came with several issues they would soon need to learn to live with.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Being starved for so long, this dog would eat ANYTHING.</li>
        <li>Joy grew up with little contact with humans and other dogs. While she is not aggressive, she does not have manners.</li>
        <li>She is not the brightest crayon in the box and will do... questionable things.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Then and Now</h2>
    <p>Despite her rough start, Joy remains loving, happy, and extremely food-motivated. Upon arrival to her forever home, she was still severely underweight and had a long journey ahead to a healthy weight. She didn't mind, though! Eating is her favorite thing!</p>

    <p>Over time, she went from a 29lb underweight hound, to a 65lb sweet girl! She is finally healthy, happy, and in a home that will ensure she has the most fulfilling life.</p>
